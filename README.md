## **CHAT APP USING RSA** <br /> <br />
### Basically, the projected messaging/chat app is anticipated to supply a line between client via a server using encryption based on RSA in a Client/Server environment. The goal of this project is to use client/server design to accomplish secure chat between clients. The used client/server model describes how a server provides resources and services to a client. A secure chat service provides the ability to have real time secure discussions among users electronically, one-to-one.<br /> <br />
